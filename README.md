# AeroHarvest

AeroHarvest is an innovative fruit-plucking drone project that leverages the power of deep learning and aerial technology to revolutionize the way we harvest fruits. The project aims to create a smart and efficient solution for identifying ripe fruits, plucking them from trees, and safely delivering them to a designated collection point.

## Features

- **Aerial Harvesting:** Utilize drone technology to navigate orchards and identify ripe fruits from the air.
- **Deep Learning Integration:** Implement advanced deep learning algorithms to accurately recognize and classify different types of fruits.
- **Precision Plucking:** Develop a mechanism for the drone to gently pluck the identified fruits without causing damage.
- **Basket Collection System:** Design a collection system on the drone for safely storing and transporting the harvested fruits.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Create an intuitive interface for users to control the drone, monitor harvesting progress, and customize settings.
